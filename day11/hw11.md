## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

```
1. p -> q
2. p -> r
3. (q AND r) -> q
4. (r AND q) -> r
5. p -> (q AND r)
```

### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_

```
1. p -> (q OR r)
2. p -> (q OR ~r)
3. p -> ((q OR ~r) AND (q or r))
4. p -> (q OR (~r AND r))
5. p -> (q OR F)
6. p -> q
```

## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]

_p_ | _q_ | _r_ | _p -> q_ | _p -> r_ | _(q AND r)_ | _p -> (q AND r)_ 
:--:|:---:|:---:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:---------------:
0   | 0   | 0   |    1     |    1     |     0       |        1        
0   | 0   | 1   |    1     |    1     |     0       |        1        
0   | 1   | 0   |    1     |    1     |     0       |        1        
0   | 1   | 1   |    1     |    1     |     1       |        1        
1   | 0   | 0   |    0     |    0     |     0       |        0        
1   | 0   | 1   |    0     |    1     |     0       |        0        
1   | 1   | 0   |    1     |    0     |     0       |        0        
1   | 1   | 1   |    1     |    1     |     1       |        1        

## III. Tautology, satisfiable, contradiction

Which of the following are tautologies?  Satisfiable?  Unsatisfiable (contradictions)?

### 1. _(p AND q AND r) -> (p OR q)_

Satisfiable and tautology (?)

### 2. _((p -> q) AND (q -> r)) -> (p -> r)_

Satisfiable (Rules of Inference Transitivity)

### 3. _(p -> q) -> p_

Unsatisfiable. For example, if _~q_ then _~q -> ~p_, so we have _(p -> q)_ is still T, but _~p_. Thus, _(p -> q) -> p_ is invalid.

### 4. _(p OR q OR r) AND ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r)) AND (p OR (NOT q)) AND (q OR (NOT r)) OR (r OR (not p))_ 



```
Unsatisfiable.
Since everything is AND-ed together, if any of

_p_, _q_, _r_ then _((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r))_ is false.
_p_, _q_, ~_r_ then _(r OR (not p))_ is false.
_p_, ~_q_, _r_ and _~p_, _q_, _r_ also cannot satisfy due to symmetry
```

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_



## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (s -> t)))_

```
1. p OR (q AND ~(r AND (s -> t)))
2. p OR (q AND ~(r AND (~s OR t)))
3. p OR (q AND ~( (r AND ~s) OR (r AND t)))
4. p OR (q AND ( ~(r AND ~s) AND ~(r AND t)))
5. p OR (q AND ( (~r OR s) AND (~r OR ~t)))
6. p OR (q AND (~r OR s) AND (~r OR ~t))
7. (p OR q) AND (p OR ~r OR s) AND (p OR ~r OR ~t)
```

## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

If _p_ is true, then the statement is true. Thus it is satisfiable.

I used a short certificate to make this determination.
